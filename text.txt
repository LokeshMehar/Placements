## Detailed Text Content for Each Slide

### Slide 1: Introduction - What You'll Present
**Main Content:**
- Edge computing has fundamentally changed how we deploy and manage infrastructure
- Unlike traditional data centers with stable, high-bandwidth connections, edge environments are characterized by:
  - Geographic distribution across unstable networks
  - Resource constraints (limited CPU, memory, bandwidth)
  - High node volatility and frequent failures
- Traditional centralized monitoring systems like Prometheus or Zabbix create single points of failure
- When the central server goes down, entire monitoring visibility is lost
- High network latency to reach geographically distant edge nodes
- Centralized approaches consume excessive bandwidth by funneling all data to one point
- This creates a critical need for a fundamentally different approach: decentralized monitoring

### Slide 2: Abstract - What You'll Present
**Main Content:**
- Our solution integrates three cutting-edge technologies into one cohesive framework
- **Gossip Protocol**: Enables peer-to-peer communication where each node shares information with random neighbors, ensuring eventual consistency across the network
- **Priority Filtering**: Implements intelligent data reduction by classifying metrics based on importance and volatility, dramatically reducing network overhead
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Provides trustworthy data retrieval through leaderless quorum consensus
- The system is designed to be resource-aware, fault-tolerant, and fully decentralized
- No single point of failure, scales naturally with network size
- Container-based implementation makes it portable and easy to deploy

### Slide 3: Motivation - What You'll Present
**Main Content:**
- **Single Point of Failure Problem**: In centralized systems, if the monitoring server fails, you lose all visibility into your infrastructure - this is unacceptable in critical edge deployments
- **High Latency Issues**: Edge nodes might be thousands of kilometers away from the central server, creating significant delays in both data collection and alerting
- **Network Congestion**: All monitoring data converging to one central point creates bandwidth bottlenecks, especially problematic in edge environments with limited connectivity
- **Scalability Limits**: Adding more nodes requires proportionally more resources at the central server
- **Solution Vision**: A distributed system where each node maintains partial system state and collectively provides complete monitoring coverage
- Resilient to individual node failures, self-healing network topology

### Slide 4: Research Gap - What You'll Present
**Main Content:**
- **Existing Gossip Protocols**: Well-established for state dissemination in distributed systems, proven fault-tolerant and scalable
- **However**: Traditional gossip approaches are "dumb" - they broadcast everything to everyone, wasting precious bandwidth
- **Resource Constraints Reality**: Edge environments have limited network bandwidth, making naive gossiping inefficient
- **Value of Information Theory**: Academic concept exists for prioritizing information based on utility, but lacks practical implementation
- **The Missing Bridge**: No existing framework combines gossip protocols with intelligent, resource-aware filtering specifically for edge monitoring
- **Our Innovation**: We bridge this gap by implementing Value of Information principles as a practical priority-based filtering mechanism integrated directly into the gossip protocol

### Slide 5: Exploration 1 - Gossip Protocol Basics - What You'll Present
**Main Content:**
- **Rumor Spreading Analogy**: Like how rumors spread in social networks, each node shares information with a few random neighbors
- **Push-Pull Mechanism**: Nodes both send their information (push) and request information from others (pull), ensuring bidirectional data flow
- **Eventual Consistency**: Mathematical guarantee that all nodes will converge to the same state given enough time
- **Fault Tolerance**: Network can lose multiple nodes without losing information - redundancy is built into the protocol
- **Scalability**: Communication complexity grows logarithmically, not linearly, with network size
- **Periodic Nature**: Gossip cycles occur at regular intervals, creating predictable communication patterns
- **Randomization**: Random peer selection prevents network partitions and ensures even distribution

### Slide 6: Exploration 2 - Priority-Based Filtering - What You'll Present
**Main Content:**
- **HIGH Priority Metrics**: CPU utilization, memory pressure, critical service health - highly volatile and operationally critical, always transmitted
- **MEDIUM Priority Metrics**: Disk I/O, network utilization - moderately important, transmitted when significant changes occur
- **LOW Priority Metrics**: Storage capacity, system uptime - stable metrics, transmitted periodically or on major changes
- **Dynamic Classification**: Metrics can change priority based on system conditions (e.g., disk space becomes HIGH priority when approaching full)
- **Bandwidth Savings**: Preliminary testing shows 60-80% reduction in network traffic compared to unfiltered gossip
- **Contextual Intelligence**: System learns which metrics matter most for specific operational scenarios
- **Threshold-Based Triggering**: Significant changes trigger immediate transmission regardless of priority

### Slide 7: Exploration 3 - Data Model Design - What You'll Present
**Main Content:**
- **Version Counter**: Monotonically increasing number ensures data freshness - nodes can detect and reject stale information
- **Heartbeat Timestamp**: Proves node liveness - other nodes can detect failed nodes when heartbeats stop arriving
- **Digest Hash**: Cryptographic hash ensures data integrity during transmission - detects corruption or tampering
- **Application State**: Contains the actual monitoring metrics in structured format
- **Compact Design**: Entire data structure optimized for minimal network footprint while maintaining all necessary metadata
- **Atomic Updates**: Version counter ensures that partial updates are impossible - data is either completely fresh or completely stale
- **Self-Validating**: Each message can be independently verified for integrity and freshness without external dependencies

### Introduction Notes:
- Edge computing creates new monitoring challenges
- Traditional centralized systems fail in volatile environments
- Need for decentralized approach

### Abstract Notes:
- Combines three key technologies
- Focus on practical implementation
- Addresses real-world constraints

### Motivation Notes:
- Centralized systems create bottlenecks
- Edge environments are inherently unstable
- Resource constraints demand efficiency

### Research Gap Notes:
- Gossip protocols exist but lack resource awareness
- VoI concepts are theoretical
- Need practical integration

### Exploration Notes:
1. **Gossip Protocol**: Explain rumor-spreading analogy, eventual consistency
2. **Priority Filtering**: Demonstrate bandwidth savings, metric classification
3. **Data Model**: Emphasize integrity guarantees, version control

## Presentation Tips:

- Use animations to show processes
- Prepare detailed explanations verbally

- Be ready to explain the "why" behind each design choice
